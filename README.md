Challenge 01


#Description
A simple webpage that has been better optimized for the accessibility of both the developer and the user.


#Features
a descriptive CSS and HTML file that is organized for navigation. A webpage that is optimized to look like the provided example but with much cleaner and DRY-er code
This code features a significant amount more semantic HTML elements for accessibility, a logical structure to the HTML, alt image attributes, sequential elements, and a short descriptive title. I have also modified the CSS to be significantly more precise and easy to navigate, while also adding some slight flex features for added accessibility on
different types of screens.


#Install
Simply download and open the HTML in your browser or open through GH.
